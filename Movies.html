	<p> <font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the Fast and Furious. It's a series
	of movies that is starred by Vin Diesel & the late Paul Walker. I don't have any specific favorite because I love
	all of it. It's a movie about Bryan O'Conner who is a police officer and Dominic Toretto who is an excellent race car driver
	and a big time theif, and their journey from being enemies to friends to brothers together with their family and friends.
	Apart from the fact that I love movies about fast cars and action, I love this movie series because of its content.
	The story is not just about cars and action but also about family. It shows that family is not always bond by blood
	but by friendship, and at the end of the day, family is whom we can always count on. Its famous lines "ride or die"
	which means that we should live life to the fullest & "salute mi familia" which is about respect for family
	captured my attention and since then, those lines have been part of my life mantra.
