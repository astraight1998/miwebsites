	<p align="center"> <font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are my favorite songs because
	the message of the songs really touches my heart. Apart from the fact that Michael Jackson & Charice Pempengco are 
	really good singers, I feel like the songs really speak to me on a spiritual level. I hope that you appreciate
	the message of the songs as I do and I also hope that you enjoy listening to it. </font> </p>

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya see
Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

[Bridge]
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
Cause when you close your heart
Then you close your mind

[Outro]
Make that change!

[Verse 1]
If I wrote a note to God
I would speak what's in my soul
I'd ask for all the hate
To be swept away
For love to overflow

If I wrote a note to God
I'd pour my heart out on each page
I'd ask for war to end
And for peace to mend this world
I'd say, I'd say

I'd say give us the strength
To make it through
Help us find love
'Cause love is overdue
And it seems like
So much is going wrong
On this road we're on

[Verse 2]
If I wrote a note to God
I'd say please help us find a way
End all the bitterness
Put some tenderness in our hearts
I'd say, I'd say

[Chorus]
I'd say give us the strength
To make it through
Help us find love
'Cause love is overdue
And it looks like
We haven't got a clue
Need some help from you

Grant us the faith to carry on
Give us hope
When it seems all hope is gone
'Cause it seems like
So much is going wrong
On this road we're on

[Bridge]
No, no
We can't do it on our own
So, so

[Repeat Chorus]

No, no
We can't do it on our own
So, so
If I wrote a note to God!
