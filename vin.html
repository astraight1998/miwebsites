	<font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This handsome guy's real
	name is Mark Sinclair but he is famously known by his screen name <em> <u> Vin Diesel. </u> </em>
	I really love this guy because he has a good heart, he's family oriented and he value his friends 
	so much. I'm pretty sure that everybody
	knows this guy. He's already starred in many films like <u> Riddick, Triple X, Guardians of the Galaxy, 
	The Pacifier, The Last Witch Hunter, Pitch Black, A Man Apart </u>
	and his most famous movie series, the <u> Fast and Furious </u> and many other more. I first saw him in the 
	movie Fast and Furious and he's been my favorite hollywood celebrity since then. </font> </p>

	<font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is Celestine Gonzaga but 
	is mostly known as <em> <u> Toni Gonzaga. </u> </em> I really like her because she's a good actress. 
	I also love her movies that are mostly comedies. Apart from being a good actress, she is also a good singer.
	She's very talented because she is also a good host of the famous reality TV show, Pinoy Big Brother. 
	She's also a devoted Christian and a role model to everyone. What I like most about her is that she
	is a transparent person, she is what she is on and off the camera. </font> </p>
