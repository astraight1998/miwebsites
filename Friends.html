	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  These are my main girls. We've been friends for almost
	10 years now and we've through a lot together but our friendship still remains. </p>
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Our squad was formed when we were in 
	our 4th grade, we were all transferees during that time, 
	it's unexpected because we're really opposite from each other but somehow we managed to overcome our differences
	and became the best of friends. We call ourselves ALAN because it is the acronym of our first names. Althea,
	Lisa, Alleah & Nadine. It wasn't a smooth sailing relationship, we were young and immature back then so we
	always fight over petty reasons but at the end of the day, we always reconcile with each other. I treasure them 
	like my own sisters. 
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our bonding is just simple, we hang-out in each
	other's house and talk with each other all day, sometimes we play games or watch movies.
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our friendship is low maintennance because even though
	we don't talk and see each other for months, we don't lose the friendship and be awkward whenever we see each
	other again. As of now, Althea is studying at UPHSD- LP, Lisa is in Japan, Nadine is studying in UP Diliman and 
	I on DLSU-D. </p>

	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This is my squad from high school. We're composed of seven individuals. </p>
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's called DKC because it was named after our so-called 
	leader Shay. We were just teasing her about her eyebrows because it's thick 
	then we formed the name De Leon's Kilay Clan and we started calling
	our squad like that since then. We are Lil, Chell, Kath, Tere, Shay, Shai and me. Tere only joined on the latter 
	part of the school year because she got close to Kath and Shaira then she also got close to the rest of us. 
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our bonding is also just a simple one. We just roam around the different
	<em> baranggays </em> in <em> Area C </em> where our school is located and we go to our other classmates' house. Sometimes we also
	watch movies and sleepover Kath's house. There are also times when we were in school that we would ask one of our classmates
	to take a video of us dancing and playing while a certain song is playing. We also have a signature pose, I don't know what it's
	called but it's what we did in the picture on the right. It's actually the first and last time that we were able to pose like that 
	as a complete group. 
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of now, we haven't seen Shaira and Tere since graduation because they're both working while the rest
	of us are studying. The five of us still hang-out whenever we have free time since our houses are only close to each other.</p>

	<td colspan="3"> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my college squad. I never thought that these girls 
	would be my closest friends because I didn't think we would really click but guess what? We did. 
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We call ourselves UNO because
	we became closer because of the card game, UNO. It was formed when we were in our first year in college.
	We became a group in aerobics in PE class and that's where our friendship started. We are Bernades, Danie, Elai, Ina, 
	Hanna and Zelina. 
	Even though we don't have a lot 
	in common, we still became very close with each other. Some of us are shy and some of us are loud. Some of us are a fan of kpop and some
	aren't but we still managed to settle our differences. 
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With this squad, our bonding is a mixture of simple and a well
	prepared bonding. When it's not planned, we usually end up in the place of Elai. When our bond is planned, 
	sometimes we would prepare potluck dishes and have a picnic somewhere in Tagaytay or Laguna and many other bonds. 
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We also have this signature pose called the "jeje pose" and 
	we take a picture of ourselves doing this whenever we bond or atleast once every sem. 
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we are the only complete squad from our original block and we plan to keep it that way until we 
	graduate. We help each other by sharing our skills and abilities in order to pass our subjects. We cheer each other up and 
	keep each other motivated because we believe that it's what friends do. </font> </p>
