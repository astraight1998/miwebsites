	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; It's not actually because of the taste, although I also love it's taste. 
	Out of all the other delicious food in the world. Why this one? There is a story behind why this is my
	favorite food. </p>
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; When I was in third year high school, I transferred to another
	school in Dasma and live with in my grandma's house for some reason. Our own house is located in Bacoor.
	The original set-up is that, I will go home to Bacoor during weekends. But that is not what happened, due to 
	the demand of schoolworks, there are many times that I wasn't able to go home to Bacoor so sometimes I would 
	only see my parents, especially my dad, twice a month because sometimes my mom would stay with me in my 
	grandma's house. My dad is also working during that time. Now, what my dad would do whenever we haven't seen 
	each other for a week is that he would buy 2-3 chicken sandwich from mcdo and drop it off at my school before 
	he goes to work and I will pick it up before going to class. That's the only time that we would see each other, 
	it was always a brief moment but it was enough for us. 
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; Since then, it became my favorite until now. If it wasn't obvious
	I'm a very sentimental person. I always like to assign or attach meanings to objects that would remind me of 
	a certain memory from the past. </p>
