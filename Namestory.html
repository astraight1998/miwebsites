	<p align="justified"> <font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; Hi. I'm Alleah 
	Marie G. Derecho. My first name "Alleah" is the combination
	of my father's nickname "Al" and my mother's name "Lea". My dad was the one who came up with it. 
	They told me that they were just crossing the street when my dad just muttered it to my mom who was 
	7 months pregnant at that time. Actually, their first choice was "Ma. Alleah" but my dad objected so 
	it became "Alleah Marie". Some people find it cool that it's the combination of my parents' name. 
	I think it's cool too, to be honest. Gillesania is from my mom's maiden name and Derecho is obviously 
	from my dad's. </font> </p>
