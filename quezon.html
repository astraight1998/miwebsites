	<font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is Hondagua, Lopez, Quezon. 
	Hondagua is the name of the <em> baranggay. </em> Its name means "deep water" which is self-explanatory, it 
	is definitely located near the beach. 
	This is the province of my father. He spent his childhood there until he graduates elementary. Then they went
	to Manila, but they didn't sell the house in Quezon so it became a vacation house whenever we would spend our vacation there. 
	We always go there every vacation in time to celebrate the 
	<em> fiesta </em> which is celebrated on the 14th day of May
	but I haven't been able to go there since I entered college partly because 
	of the academic calendar. </font> </p>

	<font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> These are my favorite cousins
	on my father's side. <em> Ate Ji (girl wearing blue), Ate Jen (girl wearing white), Kuya Kev (guy at the back) </em> while <em>
	Kuya Kyle (guy wearing blue), Kuya Benjie (guy carrying little girl)
	Brix (boy wearing yellow), IB (girl wearing yellow) </em> & me (girl in the middle) lives in Manila & Bacoor. 
	We've been close since we were kids until now. We always 
	talk to each other from time to time and even though our cousins in Quezon already 
	have their own families, they still make time to bond with us together with
	their kids. We would always go to the pool or beach whenever we go there but since our house is near
	the beach, we mostly go there.  </font> </p>
