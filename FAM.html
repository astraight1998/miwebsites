	<p>	<font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF>  &nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see I am an only child, and
	these are my parents. Alejandro B. Derecho is the whole name of my dad, his mostly known as "Al" and my mom's 
	full name is Lea G. Derecho and her nickname is "Ley". They got married on May 3, 1998 on the same year that
	I was born. They have been happily married for nineteen years now. My mom's birthday is on May 12, 1961
	and my dad's birthday is on March 20, 1967. My mom is six years older than my dad. When you think about it, 
	it's kind of weird that my mom is already in her first grade when my dad was born but I guess age doesn't 
	really matter when it's true love. My mom is already 38 years old when she had me, she was too old for having 
	her first baby that's why her pregnancy was complicated. The doctor just took really good care of us that's why
	I was able to live. It would be too dangerous for her if she had another baby that is why I'm just an only child.

	<p> <font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a kid, I was closer to my dad because he was 
	the one taking care of me while my mom was working but when I was in high school, they exchanged roles. My father worked and my mom took
	care of me so I grew closer to my mom. Now, I'm proud to say that I'm very close to both of them. </font> </p>
	
	<p> <font face="century gothic" size="3" color=#0455CF> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, they are both working. My dad works at a real estate company as a driver and my mom works at a private school canteen
	as an overall supervisor. </font> </p>
